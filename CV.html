    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm deeply interested in the Digital Healthcare space, and have deep expertise across strategy, transformation, and
        regulatory frameworks. I am particularly interested in mental health, having worked to identify a Go-To-Market plan for Wesfarmers
        Health on this industry, including talking to startups on integrating their products into our suite and assessing commercial arrangements to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm looking for a role to support with Ops/GTM in a Digital Health focused company, across consumer fitness/wellness. With my experiences (below), and my interest - 
        I think I would be a great fit for any organisation looking to scale up.
    </p>
    <p> 
        I am currently working with Wesfarmers Health with the transformation team on turning the business around. 
        The responsibilities here are vastly identical to the role of an Analyst with creating detailed financial models 
        and presentations as well as liaising with other advisers both internally and externally on ongoing projects, 
        and have previously worked as a corporate solicitor in Perth where I was exposed to a range of transactions from ECM to M&A/Carveouts. 
        As a result I have deep experiences in both the healthcare and mining sectors.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Additionally, I have also worked at Resource Capital Funds and Wesfarmers Chemical Energy & Fertilisers 
        in supporting their deal teams on acquisitions. 
        Examples include RCF’s cornerstone investment into Pilbara Minerals when it acquired Altura, 
        and evaluating acquisition opportunities in fertilisers/explosives as a mining service/commodity transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        I obtained a Juris Doctor from UWA in 2021, and a Bachelor of Commerce from 2019 also from UWA, where I majored in Finance and Economics.
        I also am pleased to announce I have recently been admitted to Cambridge University to undertake coursework on Digital Healthcare and its Innovation.
        Lastly, I am also branching out into web development, and am excited to showcase my professional and personal experiences here.
